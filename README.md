# HCI Project - Exam Proctoring System Using Face Detection
This project was completed in Spring 2023 as a final group project for the HCI course. The objective was to build an Exam Proctoring System Using Face Detection. We utilized Mediapipe, OpenCV, Tensorflow, and Keras.

*Following is the list of files contained in this folder:
1. face_detection_data_collection.py: this file is to collect the data using a Webcam for each right, left, and normal look.
2. exam_monitoring_train.py: this file is to train the Neural Network model and test the model.
3. model_predict.py: this file is to evaluate the performance of the trained model in predicting and classifying the student's behavior using a live Webcam.
